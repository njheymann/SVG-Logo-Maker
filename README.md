# SVG-Logo-Maker
A logo generator for your business!

## User Story
AS a business owner with no logo  
I WANT to generate a simple logo to use on my website  
SO THAT I dont have to pay a graphic designer  

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a node.js command line application with user inputs  
WHEN I am asked for initials for my logo  
THEN I can enter up to three characters  
WHEN I am prompted for a colour of the text  
THEN I can add colour keywords or hexadecimal numbers  
WHEN I am prompted for a shape of my logo  
THEN I can choose from 3 shapes (circle, square, triangle)  
WHEN I am prompted for a colour for my shape  
THEN I can choose a colour keyword or hexadecimal number  
ONCE I have finished answering the questions in the command line  
THEN an SVG file is made, named 'logo.svg' and a command line string appears saying "Generated logo.svg"  
WHEN I preview the logo.svg file  
THEN I can view a 300x200 pixel image that matches my logo criteria  
WHEN I run a test  
THEN I am prompted with tests that have passed with correct criteria
